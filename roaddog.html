        <!-- overview -->
        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p> The objective of this project was to create a native mobile app that solved a specific problem. My personal experience as a musician in the DIY community guided my decision to create an artist - friendly music listening app. The most
          popular players left room for improvement but my main focus would be on basic functions and familiarity.
        </p>
      </div><!-- end overview -->

      <div>
        <!-- project proposal guidelines -->
        <h2>Proposal</h2>
        <p>In my proposal for this project I provide an analysis of my competitors and then explain that I aim to provide the best of both worlds with a music streaming app that is artist friendly. I explain who I am designing for and what they will
          be accomplishing with this app. Then I provide both a user flow diagram and low fidelity wireframes to visually map this activity.

      <div>
        <!-- patterns -->
        <h2>Patterns Defined</h2>
        <p>To ensure I was designing for my user first - for familiarity and usability, I defined common mobile patterns and applied them to my designs.
        </p>

        <!-- competitive landscape -->
        <h2>Competitve Landscape</h2>
        <p>Learning from others also ensures that I will be able to design something that puts the user at ease with familiarity. Here I am pointing out features from Youtube Music, Bandcamp, and Spotify and how I incorporate the most successful
          points nto my own work.

        <p>It’s effective to have the cast to device button always available. It would be good if it’s location were consistent. Tabs to segment content work well.

        <p>Keeping the music player controls hidden until the user needs them saves a lot of space, effectively managing data for the user.

        <p>Spotify provides a quick way to divide content with cards. This looks much tidier than Bandcamp which is overloading their table view with imagery.
          Using cards or a collection view initially and then a table view for more specific content may work better and still feel familiar.

      <div>
        <!-- sound and haptics -->
        <h2>Sound & Haptics</h2>
        <p>Keeping it minimal, I annotated how sound and physical feedback would work within this app.
        </p>

      <div>
        <!-- mobile gestures -->
        <h2>Mobile Gestures</h2>
        <p>I wanted RoadDog app to feel empowering to it’s users so I stuck to the most well known gestures to allow users to navigate the app with confidence. Here I annotate those gestures throughout my screens, both iOS and Android.
        </p>

      <div>
        <!-- mid-fidelity -->
        <h2>Mid-Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
        <p>I was using mid-fidelity wireframes for my annotations. This allowed me to display and explain these features without color and copy becoming a distraction.
        </p>
        <picture>
          <source srcset="img/roaddog/mid-fidelity.1x.png" media="(max-width:767px)">

      </div> <!-- end mid-fidelity -->

      <div>
        <!-- feedback and results -->
        <h2>Feedback & Results</h2>
        <p>Adding color, imagery and final copy brought my designs to a point where I could test prototypes interactively. I used InVision to create an interactive prototype and gleaned a few improvements from the process.
        </p>
        <picture>

        </picture>
        <p>Most of the pain points that I rooted out during testing were related to my prototype and fine-tuning the transitions and hot spots. People told me RoadDog felt familiar and intuitive. My tutor, Francis gave me more precise feedback that I
          could apply to my design. He had suggestions on the layout and my alignment which helped me create a polished final product.

        <p>Prototyping my designs also helped me catch small imperfections in my placement. The card on the second line of Recommended for you suggestions that reads “Donald Giannati” is three pixels off the grid. Seeing my screens in sequence
          illuminates these tiny flaws.

      <div>
        <!-- final designs -->
        <h2>Final Designs</h2>
        <p>I used my personal knowledge and paid careful attention to the market landscape to design this native app. For me RoadDog was a great test in how well I can apply my new skills in a way that will be expected by most users.
        </p>

      <div>
        <!-- Takeaway -->
        <h2>Takeaway</h2>
        <p> Preparing this proposal and completing these designs challenged me to tie together different parts of my life and personality and all the skills I had learned up to this point. This project marked my first time designing in Figma and
          helped further my skills with InVision. Before this project, I wasn't very familiar with mobile music players since I own many physical recordings. After choosing to tackle this project, I quickly defined the expected. It was an adventure,
          embracing a popular type of app from a different perspective and discovering a way to combine my aesthetic with usability. If I were to spend more time on this project, I would want to introduce a marketplace similar to Bandcamp, where the
          artist could sell their recordings and listeners could collect a library.
